# BeepyDev

Hi, I'm BeepyDev. I love coding in Python and JavaScript. I hate semicolons with a passion.

I started coding in Scratch, then switched to web development, and now I mainly code in Python.

## What I'm working on

I'm currently coding a language called Y, which is like Python but with syntax I like better (curly brackets!!!).<br>
[You can check out its development progress here](https://github.com/BeepyDev/Y).

My greatest accomplishment is winning first place in [a statewide highschool coding contest](https://www.indianatsa.org). (Wish me luck at nationals!)
