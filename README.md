# BeepyDev

I hate semicolons with a passion, that's pretty much all you need to know. (I make an exception for PHP.)

My current obsession is backend web development, especially PHP.

## What I'm working on

Working on a full-stack social media platform framework, using PHP and HTML/CSS/JS (notably no SQL).

## Greatest accomplishment

My greatest accomplishment is winning first place in a statewide highschool [coding contest](https://www.indianatsa.org).

## Website

You can view my website [here](http://beepydev.infinityfreeapp.com), but I haven't built a homepage yet so you'll need to have a direct project url.
