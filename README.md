# BeepyDev

Semicolons scare me. Average Python dev.

## What I'm working on

A programming language for frontend web development

## Greatest accomplishment

My greatest accomplishment is winning first place in a statewide highschool [coding contest](https://www.indianatsa.org).

## Website

You can view my website [here](http://beepydev.infinityfreeapp.com), but I haven't built a homepage yet so you'll need to have a direct project url.
