# BeepyDev

Hi, I'm BeepyDev. I love coding in Python and JavaScript. I hate semicolons with a passion.

I started coding in Scratch, then switched to web development, and now I mainly code in Python, C#, and Lua.

## What I'm working on

I'm working on something but it's yet to be announced.

## Greatest accomplishment

My greatest accomplishment is winning first place in [a statewide highschool coding contest](https://www.indianatsa.org). (Wish me luck at nationals!)
